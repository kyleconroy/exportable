# Google

Google was one of the first services to allow users to easily download their
data. Launched in 2011, [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com) bundles
together data from 42 different Google services, including Youtube and Gmail.

## Steps

* Sign into your Google account in your browser
* Go to "[Download your data](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout)" 
* Scroll down to the bottom and press "Next"
* Select ".tgz" as the file type
* Select "10GB" as the archive size for fewer downloads
* Press "Create Archive"

You'll receive an email once your archive is ready to download.
